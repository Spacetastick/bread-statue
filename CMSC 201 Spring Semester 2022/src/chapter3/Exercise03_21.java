(Science: day of the week) 
Zellerâ€™s congruence is an algorithm developed by Christian Zeller to calculate the day of the week.
The formula is :
h = (q + 26(m+1)/10 + k + k/4 + j/4 + 5j) % 7
where
- h is the day of the week (0: Saturday, 1: Sunday, 2: Monday, 3: Tuesday, 4: Wednesday, 5: Thursday, 6: Friday).
- q is the day of the month.
- m is the month (3: March, 4: April, ..., 12: December). January and February are counted as months 13 and 14 of the previous year.
- j is the century (i.e., year/100)
- k is the year of the century (i.e., year%100).
Note that the division in the formula performs an integer division.
Write a program that prompts the user to enter a year, month, and day of the month, and displays the name of the day of the week.
Sample Run 1
Enter year: (e.g., 2012): 2015
Enter month: 1-12:  1
Enter the day of the month: 1-31: 25
Day of the week is Sunday
Sample Run 2
Enter year: (e.g., 2012): 2012
Enter month: 1-12: 5
Enter the day of the month: 1-31: 12
Day of the week is Saturday
Sample Run 3
Enter year: (e.g., 2012): 2002 
Enter month: 1-12: 3 
Enter the day of the month: 1-31: 26 
Day of the week is Tuesday
Sample Run 4
Enter year: (e.g., 2012): 2008 
Enter month: 1-12:  1
Enter the day of the month: 1-31: 1 
Day of the week is Tuesday 
Sample Run 5
Enter year: (e.g., 2012): 2000 
Enter month: 1-12: 2 
Enter the day of the month: 1-31: 12 
Day of the week is Saturday 
(Hint: January and February are counted as 13 and 14 in the formula, so you need to convert the user input 1 to 13 and 2 to 14 for the month and change the year to the previous year.)
