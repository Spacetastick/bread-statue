 * Class: CMSC 201
 * Project 1
 * Noah Cil
 * 2/1/22, Eclipse
 * Instructor: Professor Tanveer
 * Description: This program takes a temperature between -58째F and 41째F and a wind speed of at least 2 mph as input, and uses the wind-chill temperature formula to output the wind chill temperature.
 * I pledge that I have completed the programming assignment independently.
   I have not copied the code from a student or any source.
   I have not given my code to any student.
