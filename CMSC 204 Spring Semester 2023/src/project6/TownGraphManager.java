 * Your TownGraphManager will hold an object of your Graph. There are methods to populate the graph (reading from a text file), add a town (vertices),
 * add a road (edge), list all towns and all roads, and list towns adjacent to a given town. 
 * 
 * Your solution wwill find the shortest path from a start town to a destination town. It will account for the possibility of a disjointed graph (i.e., not all
 * vertices can be reached from all other vertices). You may add any methods as needed for your design
