 * Create a class Road that can represent the edges of a Graph of Towns. The class stores references to the two vertices (Town endpoints),
 * the distance between vertices, and a name, and the traditional methods (constructors, getters/setters, toString, etc), and a compareTo,
 * which compares two Road objects. Since this is an undirected graph, an edge from A to B is equal to an edge from B to A.
